aqeCosmParser
===============

Java program that grabs Air Quality Egg (AQE) data from cosm.com

It covers all AQE tagged with "munster egg" (region of MÃ¼nster) and retreives one datapoint in five minutes via the cosm API.

You'll need to add the following external libraries to your classpath:

JSON.Simple https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/

Apache HttpComponents: http://hc.apache.org/

log4j: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/

JDBC4 Postgresql Driver: http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html

Furthermore you'll need a config.properties file with the following content in your project folder

    apikey=[your cosm api key]
    db_username=[name of your database user]
    db_password=[password for database user]
    db_url=[url to database, fomatted as: ' //hostname:port/database name ']
